# Spotter Assessment
   Build an API that takes inputs of start and finish location both within the USA
   Return a map of the route along with optimal location to fuel up along the route -- optimal mostly means cost effective based on fuel prices
   Assume the vehicle has a maximum range of 500 miles so multiple fuel ups might need to be displayed on the route
   Also return the total money spent on fuel assuming the vehicle achieves 10 miles per gallon
   Use the attached file for a list of fuel prices 
   Find a free API yourself for the map and routing
